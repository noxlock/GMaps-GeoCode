# Development Log for A2 Coder Academy

## 27/06/19

Was deciding between working on either:

- Google Maps Geocoding

- Catchphrase Generator



Decided on a project named "Phrasegen" or "Quotegen", which takes a list of 150 quotes, splices and joins them, I decided this as I had never worked with an API before, and it sounded difficult. Created a Trello board, made the program functional, made a basic README and flowchart, and pushed to git.



I plan to make arguments for the amount of quotes the program will use.

### STATUS UPDATE



Had trouble coming up with a user story for Phrasegen, as it was purely meant for fun. 

Conducted some research on using Google's API, which was my original idea. I then decided to scrap the Phrasegen project and begin work on Geo<>Code, a program which allows for random location generation, and location to geo code conversion.



Today was mainly fooling around, trying to figure out how the API exports its data, and figuring out how to make it readable, I had a lot of trouble with this, as I initially thought it was a JSON, turns out it was actually classified as a list of dictionaries, I had no idea how to iterate this so I got some help from a forum.

Started writing functions for the program, this included the main menu (gmaps_menu()), lat/longitude to location (location()), and a function to check the supplied lat/longitude is valid. (is_valid_latlong())
